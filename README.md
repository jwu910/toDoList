# toDoList
Web App to practice project organization and presentation

## Expected Behaviour 
- jQuery To DO list is responsive
- HOvering shows delete icon on the left
    Clicking it will delete the item
- Clicking the list elment will cross off the item (strike through)
- Plus sign (+) on top right will let you add a new list item
    Clicking the + will display the form with "add a new to do"
        Clicking again will hide it 
- List is centered  on the page, but doesn't take the full page (except maybe in mobile layout)
